git clone https://github.com/ThuyTran07/Helmet_Safety_Detection.git

```

**Note:** Use the provided command with caution. It will download the entire repository to your local machine.

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Here's how to do it depending on your operating system:

**Linux/macOS:**

Bash

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```

**Windows:**

Bash

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

```

**Note:** Use the provided commands with caution. They will create and activate a virtual environment named `venv`.

### Install the Required Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

Bash

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

**Note:** Use the provided command with caution. It will install all the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the App


Now that the environment is set up, you can start the Streamlit development server. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

Bash

```
streamlit run helmet_safety_detection.py

```

This will launch the Streamlit application in your web browser.
